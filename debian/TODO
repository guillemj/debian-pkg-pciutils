 - Can we ditch pcimodules yet?  Is hotplug out for etch?
 - Final hunk of diff in lspci.c
 - Remove compiler warnings
 - Add more PCIe capability decoding
 - Should we compile with -g?  Should that diff go upstream?
 - Submit DESTDIR support upstream
 - Handle short reads (eg symbios 875, IBM Citrine)

After etch:
 - Remove dependency on libpci2
